### Hi, I'm Filip âš¡

Philosophy Teacher turned Software Developer.

ðŸ’¼ I work as a Full Stack Developer at [Solgt.no](https://solgt.no).

ðŸŒ± As part of a collaborative project, Iâ€™m building a course platform web app using the new "App router" in Next.js with "Server Components" from React.js (in TypeScript). And I'm learning Rust for fun. 

ðŸ¤” To help my own understanding about the things I learn, I keep [some notes](https://www.filipniklas.com/programming/) or I make [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCucr6RJk-jCqVYWtxJQ-2Ag) about it.
