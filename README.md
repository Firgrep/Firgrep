### Hi, I'm Filip âš¡

Philosophy Teacher turned Software Developer.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working towards a Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer certification.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to solidify my understanding of the peculiarities of Next.js and React.js, get better at TypeScript, and learning Rust for fun. 

âœ… I recently ended a project that was about building a booking-system web app for a client written in TypeScript using Next.js, NextAuth, tRPC, Prisma (basically the T3 Stack), Docker and GCP. 

ðŸ¤” To help my own understanding about the things I learn, I keep a [blog](https://www.filipniklas.com/#/blog) or I make [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCucr6RJk-jCqVYWtxJQ-2Ag) about it.
